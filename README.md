CS 255 - System Analysis and Design Portfolio Submission
DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted a web-based system to help users prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to include features for scheduling lessons, accessing practice tests, and handling payments. The goal was to create an intuitive and efficient platform that made the process of learning to drive easier and more accessible.

What I Did Well
One aspect I did particularly well was the system design process. I effectively translated the client’s requirements into a structured system design document, detailing the UML diagrams, database schema, and functional components. My business requirements document was also well-structured, ensuring that user needs and system functionalities were clearly defined.

Potential Revisions and Improvements
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the system design document, particularly the UML diagrams. I would ensure they provide more detailed interactions, including edge cases and alternative flows. Additionally, I would add more user stories and scenarios to better illustrate how different users would interact with the system.

Interpreting User Needs and Implementation
To interpret the user’s needs, I relied on the business requirements document to outline key functionalities, ensuring they were directly mapped to system features. Understanding the user experience is critical in software design because a system that does not align with user expectations will lead to frustration and decreased usability. By focusing on usability, accessibility, and performance, I ensured the design would effectively serve its intended users.

Software Design Approach and Future Strategies
When designing software, I take a structured approach by following these steps:

Gather Requirements – Understanding what the client and end users need.
Create Use Cases & User Stories – Mapping out user interactions with the system.
Design System Components – Developing UML diagrams, database schemas, and system workflows.
Validate the Design – Ensuring the design meets business and technical requirements.
In future projects, I will focus more on iterative design improvements, leveraging feedback from stakeholders and users to refine the system. Additionally, I plan to use prototyping and wireframing tools to provide a more visual representation of the system before full implementation.
